      <p>The website Codecademy was quite helpful to us with this task. 
        We lacked sufficient knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; nonetheless, a certain website assisted us in improving our abilities. 
        HTML was the basis of the webpage, and we worked hard to make it well-decorated and easy to use. After learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript from CodeAcademy, we started working on our website. 
        The work was divided into 4 parts (Main Page, Information about our team members, Information about our Hour of Code project and Information about our Website project ) each member taking one of the responsibilities.</p>
