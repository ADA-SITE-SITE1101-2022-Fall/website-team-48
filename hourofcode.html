      <h1>The Hour Of Code</h1>
      <p>The Hour of Code began as a one-hour introduction to computer science, with the goal of demystifying "code," demonstrating that anyone can learn the basics, and broadening participation in the field of computer science. It has since grown into a global celebration of computer science, beginning with 1-hour coding activities and expanding to all kinds of community efforts. Examine the tutorials and activities. Over 400 partners and 200,000 educators worldwide support this grassroots campaign.</p>
